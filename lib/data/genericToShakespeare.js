  If't be true thy brain wast dynamite, th're wouldn't beest enow to bloweth thy coxcomb off. Thou art m're disappointing than an unsalt'd pretzel. 
  Lighteth travels faster than sound which is why thee hath seemed bright until thee spake. We happily did marry for one month, but unfortunately we've been married for ten years. 
  Thee has't so many gaps in thy teeth t looks liketh thy tongue is in cage. Thy secrets art at each moment safe with me, I never even listen when you tell me them. 
  I'll never forget the first timeth we hath met, but I'll keepeth trying. I forgot the world revolves 'round thee. Mine own apologies, how fartuous of me. 
  I only taketh thee everywhere I go just so I don't have to kiss thee goodbye. Holdeth still,  I'm trying to imagineth thee with personality. Our kid must have gotten his brain from you! I still have mine. 
  Thy visage maketh onions caterwauling.
  Thee behold so quaint. Not at all gross, the present day.  
  It's impossible to underestimate thee. I'm not insulting thee, I'm describing thee. 
  I'm just more cunning than thee. 
   
  Keepeth rolling thy eyes, thee might eventually findeth a brain. 
   
  Thy visage is just fine but we'll has't to putteth a container over yond personality. 
   
  Thee bring everyone so much joy, when thee leave the room. 
   
  I thought of thee the present day, it reminded me to taketh out the refuse. 
   
  Don't worry about me.  Worry about thy eyebrows. 
   
  Thou art the human version of period cramps. 
   
  If you're going to be two-faced, at least make one of them pretty. 
   
  Thou art liketh a cloud. At which hour thee disappeareth it's a quite quaint day. 
   
  I'd rather treateth my baby's diaper rash than has't lunch with thee. 
   
  Don't worry, the first forty years of childhood art at each moment the hardest. 
   
  I loveth what you've done with thy hair.  How doth thee get it to cometh out of thy nostrils liketh that?
  
  Oh mine own god! it speaks!`
