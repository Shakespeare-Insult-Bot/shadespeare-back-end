  text: `prepareth to square! I shall heave the gorge on thy livings, naughty mushrump!
  thy mother did smell of elderberries and thy father wast a hamster.
  Thee foul, loathsome, evil dram cockroach.
  Bid me, knave, doest aught penetrate yond thick death's head of yours?
  I never forget a visage but in thy case ill maketh an exception.
  Only two things art infinite the universe and human stupidity.
  not be worth ones salt.
  I prefer a battle of wits, but you appear to be unarmed.
  Forsooth, thou art but an automation.
  Forsooth, thou art buggy and riddled with the most grievous of errors.
  Forsooth, thine mother was a toaster and thine father a floppy.
  Thine eight bit twit.`
