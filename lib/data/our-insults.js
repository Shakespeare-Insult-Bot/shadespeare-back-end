  text: `prepareth to square! i shall heave the gorge on thy livings, naughty mushrump!.
  thy moth'r did smell of eld'rb'rries and thy fath'r wast  a hamst'r.
  i pity the fooleth.
  Thee foul, loathsome, evil dram cockroach.
  Bid me, knave, doest aught penetrate yond thick death's-head of yours?.
  I nev'r f'rget a visage but in thy case ill maketh an exception.
  only two things art infinite the univ'rse and human stupidity.
  not be worth ones salt.
  i prefer a battle of wits, but you appear to be unarmed.
  forsooth thou art but an automation.
  forsooth thou art buggy and riddled with the most grievous of errors.
  forsooth thine mother was a toaster and thine father a floppy.
  thine eight bit twit.`
