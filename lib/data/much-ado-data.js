  I would my horse had the speed of your tongue. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he loves me.Let me be that I am and seek not to alter me. He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man. He that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him.There was a star danced, and under that was I born. Silence is the perfectest herault of joy. I were but little happy if I could say how much.Tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once. Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, Men were deceivers ever,
  One foot in sea and one on shore, To one thing constant never. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps. I do love nothing in the world so well as you- is not that strange? I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest. Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably. I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes. For which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? Peace I will stop your mouth. Why, what’s the matter, That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness. You are thought here to the most senseless and fit man for the job. Tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once. There’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself. I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband. Pardon me: I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you. Love me! Why, it must be requited. Happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. I do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange? For which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? Suffer love,a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will. In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.I can see he's not in your good books. I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
  pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come. As much pleasure, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point, You have no stomach, signior, fare you well. Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
  such meet food to feed it. Silence is the perfectest herault of joy. I were but little happy if I could say how much. I would not deny you, but by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption. A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that. For it falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lacked and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us While it was ours. they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves. Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren; and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred. For man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. Is it not strange that sheep's guts could hail souls out of men's bodies? When you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave. There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamt of unhappiness, and waked herself with laughing. To be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites. Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years? O that he were here to write me down an ass! But masters, remember that I am an ass. Though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow, and which is more, an officer, and which is more, a householder, and which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to .and one that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had been writ down an ass! If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star! Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it. Done to death by slanderous tongue. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your grace may well say I have lost it. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love. Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues. Let every eye negotiate for itself, And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.Is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour - O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve: give not me counsel; Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words. No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel My griefs cry louder than advertisement.In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me. Men from children nothing differ. They maintained such a well organised state of evil that they wouldn’t allow any good quality to intermingle with them. O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the marketplace. do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll ever look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God. Ha! The Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbor.
