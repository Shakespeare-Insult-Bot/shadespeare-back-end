If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumbered here. While these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, gentles, do not reprehend. 
If you pardon, we will mend. As I am an honest Puck, If we have unearned luck. Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue. We will make amends ere long, 
else the Puck a liar call. So, good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. 
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, such shaping fantasies, that apprehend. More than cool reason ever comprehends. 
The lunatic, the lover and the poet. Are of imagination all compact. One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman, the lover, all as frantic, sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt. 
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth. 
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen. Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing. A local habitation and a name. 
So we grew together, like to a double cherry, seeming parted, but yet an union in partition, two lovely berries moulded on one stem.

 This flower's force in stirring love. Night and silence. Who is here? Weeds of Athens he doth wear. 
 This is he, my master said, Despised the Athenian maid and here the maiden, sleeping sound, on the dank and dirty ground. Pretty soul! 
 she durst not lie. Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy. Churl, upon thy eyes I throw. All the power this charm doth owe. When thou wakest, let love forbid. 
 Sleep his seat on thy eyelid. So awake when I am gone for I must now to Oberon.
