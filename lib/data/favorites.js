  Thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! 
  Thou hast no one good quality. 
  I never forget a hobby horse! 
  Peace, ye fat as butter. 
  I never forget a plague sore. 
  I expect from an infinite and thine eight bit twit

  Thou art unfit for my corrupted blood to rage, fetter strong madness in love indeed, for!
  I do look on an hourly promise breaker, the owner of guts, that grey Iniquity, that!
  Thine face sours ripe grapes!
  The tartness of humours, that father ruffian, that vanity in a fool and luxurious mountain goat.

  Thy visage is the most notable coward, an exception!
  I do look on an hourly promise breaker, the owner of humours, that vanity in a plague!
  Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog! Thou hast no darkness but hell!

  most notable coward, an injury!â€©`
