  Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,
  The appetite may sicken, and so die. Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit. Journeys end in lovers meeting. a young woman in love always looks like patience on a monument smiling at grief. Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better. I say there is no darkness but ignorance. O time, thou must untangle this, not I. It is too hard a knot for me t'untie. With adoration, with fertile tears,
  With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire. She never told her love, but let concealment, like a worm 'i th' bud, feed on her damask cheek. She pinned in thought; and, with a green and yellow melancholy, she sat like Patience on a monument, smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more; but indeed our shows are more than will; for we still prove much in our vows but little in our love. In nature there's no blemish but the mind.
  None can be called deformed but the unkind. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines everywhere. Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents. I have unclasp'd to thee the book even of my secret soul. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
  And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
  The quality of persons, and the time,
  And, like the haggard, check at every feather
  That comes before his eye. This is a practise
  As full of labour as a wise man's art
  For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
  But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit. Come away, come away, Death,
  And in sad cypress let me be laid;
  Fly away, fly away, breath,
  I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
  My shroud of white stuck all with yew, O prepare it!
  My part of death no one so true did share it.
  
  Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
  On my black coffin let there be strewn:
  Not a friend, not a friend greet
  My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.
  A thousand thousand sighs to save, lay me O where
  Sad true lover never find my grave, to weep there! The more fool, Madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in heaven. Conceal me what I am, and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent. By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you. My stars shine darkly over
  me. Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loathe to prove reason with them. Alas, the frailty is to blame, not we
  For such as we are made of, such we be. Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage. Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive
  If you will lead these graces to the grave
  And leave the world no copy. Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?`
