  text: `I expected this, it is exactly the artist that struggles. 
  Thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! 
  Thou hast no one good quality. 
  I never forget a hobby horse! 
  Peace, ye fat as butter. 
  I never forget a plague sore. 

  Thy visage maketh onions cry.
  Thou art unfit for my corrupted blood to rage, fetter strong madness in love indeed, for!
  I do look on an hourly promise breaker, the owner of guts, that grey iniquity!
  Thine face sours ripe grapes!
  I only taketh thee goodbye!
  Thou clay-brained guts, that father ruffian, that vanity in your conversation would infect my brain.
  Thy visage is the most notable coward!
  I do look on an hourly promise breaker, the owner of humours, that vanity in a plague!
  Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog! Thou hast no darkness but hell!
  Though art a flesh-monger, a plague sore.
  Shut your festering Gob, you dried neat's-tongue, bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish for breath to utter foul speeches.
  As much pleasure, just so much joy, when thee leave the room.`
