  Thou cream-faced loon. Thou art as loathsome as a toad. Peace, ye fat guts. I do desire we may be better strangers. Though art a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward. You scullion. You rampallian. You fustilarian.  I shall tickle your catastrophe. Thou art as fat as butter. There is no faith in thee than in a stewed prune.  Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood. Away, you three inch fool. Though art a natural coward without instinct. You, minion, are too saucy. Thou art the best of the cut-throats. A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss'd with. Your virginity breeds mites, like a cheese. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tounge, Spanish pouch. prepareth to square! I shall heave the gorge on thy livings, naughty mushrump!
  thy mother did smell of elderberries and thy father wast a hamster.
  Thee foul, loathsome, evil dram cockroach.
  Bid me, knave, doest aught penetrate yond thick death's head of yours?
  I never forget a visage but in thy case ill maketh an exception.
  Only two things art infinite the universe and human stupidity.
  not be worth ones salt.
  I prefer a battle of wits, but you appear to be unarmed.
  Forsooth, thou art but an automation.
  Forsooth, thou art buggy and riddled with the most grievous of errors.
  Forsooth, thine mother was a toaster and thine father a floppy.
  Thine eight bit twit.
