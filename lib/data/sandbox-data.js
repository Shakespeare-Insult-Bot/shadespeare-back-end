  text: 'I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries. Thee has\'t soil\'d thy armor. Keep your decaying mouth shut, you insult on an injury. Your kind of person makes me sick, you vacant, snotty nosed, stinking pervert. I expected this, it is exactly the kind of narrow minded philistine lack of understanding I expect from an uninspired piece of trash like you. Sitting on your detestable pimple ridden buttocks, not caring about anything for the artist that struggles. You would reject me from your club, won’t you? You bastard. Back at you, because even if you begged on bended knees I won\'t join your Freemason\'s society. Don\'t give me that, you snotty-faced head of parrot droppings! Shut your festering Gob, you tit! You Type makes me puke! You vacuous toffee-nosed Malodorous Pervert!'`prepareth to square! i shall heave the gorge on thy livings, naughty mushrump!.
thy moth'r did smell of eld'rb'rries and thy fath'r wast  a hamst'r.
i pity the fooleth.
Thee foul, loathsome, evil dram cockroach.
Bid me, knave, doest aught penetrate yond thick death's-head of yours?.
I nev'r f'rget a visage but in thy case ill maketh an exception.
only two things art infinite the univ'rse and human stupidity.
not be worth ones salt.
i prefer a battle of wits, but you appear to be unarmed.
forsooth thou art but an automation.
forsooth thou art buggy and riddled with the most grievous of errors.
forsooth thine mother was a toaster and thine father a floppy.
thine eight bit twit. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish! Away, you three-inch fool! Come, come, you froward and unable worms! Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy. His wit’s as thick as a Tewkesbury mustard. I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. I am sick when I do look on thee. I must tell you friendly in your ear, sell when you can, you are not for all markets. If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. I’ll beat thee, but I would infect my hands. I scorn you, scurvy companion. Methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee. More of your conversation would infect my brain. My wife’s a hobby horse! Peace, ye fat guts! Poisonous bunch-backed toad! The rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes. There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune. Thine forward voice, now, is to speak well of thine friend; thine backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. That trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Thine face is not worth sunburning. This woman’s an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure. Thou art a boil, a plague sore. Was the Duke a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward? Thou art as fat as butter. Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad. Like the toad; ugly and venomous. Thou art unfit for any place but hell. Thou cream faced loon. Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat. Thou elvish-mark’d, abortive, rooting hog! Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! Thou lump of foul deformity. That poisonous bunch-back’d toad! Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou whoreson zed , thou unnecessary letter! Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade. Thy tongue outvenoms all the worms of Nile. Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon. Would thou wouldst burst! You poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen mate! You are as a candle, the better burnt out. You scullion! You rampallian! You fustilarian! I’ll tickle your catastrophe! You starvelling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish–O for breath to utter what is like thee!-you tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck! Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. Villain, I have done thy mother.`;
