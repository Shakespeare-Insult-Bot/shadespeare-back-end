  Thou cream-faced loon.  Thou art as loathsome as a toad.  Peace, ye fat guts.  I do desire we may be better strangers.  Though art a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward.  You scullion.  You rampallian.  You fustilarian.  I shall tickle your catastrophe.  Thou art as fat as butter.  There is no faith in thee than in a stewed prune.  Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood.  Away, you three inch fool.  Though art a natural coward without instinct.  You, minion, are too saucy.  Thou art the best of the cut-throats.  A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss'd with.  Your virginity breeds mites, like a cheese.  Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tounge, Spanish pouch.
